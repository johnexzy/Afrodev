A while ago I reconnected with an old friend I used to build and hack with. We hadn't spoken in years. When we finally got back in touch, I pulled up the [KP Astro](https://kpastro.ai) system I'd been working on and ran his details through it.

The results caught both of us off guard. The analysis didn't just throw out vague statements. It spoke directly to what he had been experiencing: why he felt distracted, why coding no longer felt natural, and how he could lean into certain traits to navigate his work better.

He looked at me and said, "John, tell me you didn't hack this to target me."

I hadn't. That was when I realized this system wasn't just another software project. It was capable of producing insights people could actually relate to. Out of curiosity, I checked my own details right after and I was just as surprised. At that point, KP Astro stopped being just an assignment.

## Why KP Astro

When the project first came to me, I had no knowledge of KP Astrology. To most people it is simply another branch of astrology. To me, it looked like a stack of unfamiliar concepts: planetary sub lords, house cusps, ruling planets, and dashas.

What changed things was seeing the structure behind it all. **KP Astrology is logical**. It is built on rules, sequences, and mathematical precision. Once I realized that, the problem became clearer: how to engineer a system that could process those rules, calculate outcomes in real time, and present them in a way that feels approachable.

## What the System Does

You can see [KP Astro](https://kpastro.ai) in action to explore all these features yourself.

### Chart Generation
- Birth and Horary charts with South Indian style visualization
- Multiple Ayanamsa options, including KP_New
- Rotation by house or degree for specialized analysis
- Real time planetary positions with retrograde indicators

### Astrological Analysis
- Full ABCD analysis of planets and houses
- Complete Vimshottari Dasa calculations
- Ruling planet combinations and strength assessments
- Prediction templates across all twelve houses

### AI Assisted Narratives
- Insights covering career, marriage, health, property, litigation, travel, and more
- Ability to generate focused predictions for specific life areas
- Natural language outputs that transform calculations into something readable

### User Experience
- Google Maps integration for location input
- Auto or manual coordinates with validation
- Chart saving, loading, and PDF export
- Authentication for personalized chart storage

### Almanac Features
- Daily, zodiac, motion, and nakshatra transits
- Ruling planet transit combinations
- Calculations for auspicious days

## Engineering the System

The real work was in the architecture.

### Frontend
Built on Next.js with TypeScript, styled with TailwindCSS and Radix UI. The focus was on rendering speed and responsiveness, especially with complex charts.

### Backend and Services
The system is split into services:

- **Main backend** handles authentication, user accounts, and chart storage.
- **Calculation service** processes heavy computational tasks like astrological analysis.
- **Database** stores all persistent data.
- **Cache layer** provides fast lookups for frequent requests.

### Messaging
Apache Kafka connects the pieces. Heavy computation is queued so the API never blocks, keeping the app responsive even under load.

### Infrastructure
All services are containerized. Docker Compose orchestrates them in both development and production. Deployment is automated with Pulumi, which provisions Google Cloud Compute Engine, firewall rules, and networking as code.

### CI/CD
GitHub Actions handles the build pipeline. Tests run on every change, maintaining over 95 percent coverage. Images are built and pushed to GHCR and Docker Hub, then pulled onto the VM where Docker Compose restarts the services with the latest release.
