If you're tired of hearing the term "Jamstack" but still curious about what it means, don't worry! We'll explain it in a simple way.

We'll be creating a basic blog that is affordable to run, fast, and secure. We'll use NextJS to generate the website statically, and we'll get our blog posts from the public API of WordPress.

> A basic understanding of JavaScript and React will be helpful in following along

Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation are two modern approaches to building web applications that are fast, efficient, and optimized for search engines. By moving some of the workloads from the client's browser to the server, these techniques help to reduce the overall page load time and improve the user experience.

## Requirement

* [NextJs](https://nextjs.org)
* Node v14.6 or newer
* npx

npx just like npm is an ePackage runner. It runs hosted packages from the npm registry. We'll be using npx to install NextJs

    npx create-next-app@latest <project-name>

`create-next-app` is a package hosted on the registry, here we ran that package using npx.

Feel free to name your project as you like. I‚Äôll name this leccel-blog.

    npx create-next-app@latest leccel-blog --typescript

On the CLI, I selected all the default configurations. (Hit "Enter" to keep going").

When the installation is complete run

    cd leccel-blog && code .

We can start the development server and preview the default app in the browser.

    npm run dev

Our default NextJs app is running on the browser. everything working as expected and our focus directory is the `pages` directory where all our routes point to the `index.tsx`. A second page is required to show the post detail when clicked. We can name this page `[slug].tsx` . This is how dynamic routes are created in NextJs. Let's move this new file into a `posts` folder. The new pages structures look more like this

    üìÅ pages
       |__ index.tsx
       |
       |__ üìÇ posts
            |___[slug].tsx

After removing all that we don't need from `pages/index.tsx` it took this shape

```tsx
import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '@/styles/Home.module.css'


export default function Home() {
 return (
   <>
     <Head>
       <title>Leccel Blog</title>
       <meta name="description" content="A practical guide to Jamstack" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
       <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
     </Head>
     <main className={styles.main}>
       
     </main>
   </>
 )
}
```

## Choosing a cms

Jamstack applications rely on content APIs for their dynamic content. There are many CMS options to choose from, including Strapi, Contentful, and Sanity. Choose a CMS that best fits your needs and integrate it with your NextJS project.

## Index Page

In the course of this article, we'll be using a [Wordpress.com API](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/) as a CMS for our blog.  
Our blog page needs to fetch the list of blog posts from the CMS and display them on the index page.

```tsx
import Head from "next/head";
import Link from "next/link";
import styles from "@/styles/Home.module.css";

export default function Home({ posts } : any) {
  return (
    <Head>
        <title>Leccel Blog</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A practical guide to Jamstack" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h1>In the news</h1>
        <ul>
          {posts.map((post: any) => (
            <li key={post.ID}><Link href={`posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link></li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </main>
  )
}
```

To retrieve data before rendering, Next.js provides a way to export an async function called `getStaticProps` from the same file. This function is executed during the build process and allows you to send the retrieved data as props to the page for pre-rendering.

```typescript
// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Call the wordpress.com API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch(
    "https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/200671771/posts"
  );
  const allPosts = await res.json()

  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Home component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts : allPost.posts,
    },
  }
}

export default function Home({ post }: { post: any }) {
  
  ...
```

The result from the REST API has this structure. so that is why we had to call `allPosts.posts`

```js
{
	posts: [
      {
      	ID, title, content, excerpt, author,slug, featured_image ...
      }
    ]
}
```

Here's what it looks like on the browser

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cd18931-af01-46c7-9189-b26e99d786d2_1476x1530.png)

## Details Page

For the details page, `post/[slug].tsx`, we‚Äôll get the slug from the route‚Äôs param and query our CMS API for the single post's details. We'll be bringing in `getStaticProps` again. Before jumping in, we'll create some helper functions in `helpers/index.ts` to avoid redundant repition, When calling our CMS API. here's what it looks like

```typescript
export async function fetchAllPosts() {
  const res = await fetch(
    "https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/200671771/posts?fields=slug"
  );
  return await res.json();
}
  
export async function fetchSinglePost(slug: string) {
  const res = await fetch(
    `https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/200671771/posts/slug:${slug}`
  );
  return await res.json();
}
```

And then back to our `posts/[slug].tsx` we'll be use our helper function to fecth the post by it's `slug`

```typescript
import { fetchSinglePost } from "@/helpers";

export const getStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const post = await fetchSinglePost(context.params!.slug as string);

  return {
    props: { post },
  };
};

```

In the template part, we can show some of the post details

```tsx

import { fetchSinglePost, createMarkup } from "@/helpers";
import Head from "next/head";
export default function BlogPost({post}: any) {
  return (
  	<>
      <Head>
        <title>{post.title}</title>
        <meta
          name="description"
          content={post.title}
        />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <meta
          property="og:image"
          content={post.featured_image}
        />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <div className="mian">
          <div className="blog-html">
            <h1 className="text-center">
            {post.title}
            </h1>
            <div
              className="content"
              dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup(post.content)}
            ></div>
          </div>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

The post.content is in HTML format, so we need to insert it into our page. ReactJs provides a method for this using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

```tsx
function createMarkup(content: string) {
  return {__html: content};
}
<div 
  className="content" 
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup(post.content)}></div>
```
